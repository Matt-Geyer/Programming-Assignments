These are just the code files from my computer vision projects. It's been a few semesters since I've had to even
look at these, and I'm only putting them up to demonstrate some of the more challenging problems I've worked on at school.
Hopefully when I get some more time on my hands I can organize and include the images so that each project is more complete..
Until then, I'm just posting the source code.
