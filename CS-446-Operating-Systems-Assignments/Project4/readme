I will have to see if I can track down the write-up for this assignment

Basically it is a simulated CPU dispatcher. Active processes with the highest priority are given
ticks to simulate CPU time. At the end stats are printed based on what the dispatcher did.

The program accepts a file that has a processes arrival time, priorty, and number of ticks
required to run to completion. 

Once all processes have been run to completeion the program will output some statistics.
