Takes a text file that has a family tree in the format

<parent1> <parent2> <# children> <child 1> <child 2> ... <child n>

e.g.

A B 3 C D X
D Y 2 M E
M F 0
C P 1 K

The program then begins a process ( fork() ) for every child and prints the letter
with the appropriate number of tabs for each generation.

e.g.

A-B
	C-P
		K
	D-Y
		M-F
		E
	X
