Simulates the producer / consumer problem on a buffer implemented as a circular queue

Run with ./prodcon <# producers> <# consumers> <time to run>

Producers should only produce when there is empty space in the buffer.
Similarly, consumers only consume when there is something in the buffer to consume.
